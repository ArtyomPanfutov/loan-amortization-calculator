üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?
Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information by filling in the template.

Explain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:

  * Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
  * Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible. 
  * Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. 
  * Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
  * Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

## How Do I contribute to the project?
   * First, try to find an existing issue in the GitHub issues. If it does not exist - create a new one.
   * Describe your feature in detail. Try to think about edge cases and restrictions.
   * If you found an existing issue and no one working on it - write a comment that you want to implement this.
   * If you are ready to make a change - fork the repository!
   * Create a branch in the forked repository.
   * Implement the feature / fix the bug. Make sure that all the tests pass. Write new tests if it is necessary.
   * Document the changes.
   * Open a pull request from the feature branch of the forked repository to the master branch of the target repository.
